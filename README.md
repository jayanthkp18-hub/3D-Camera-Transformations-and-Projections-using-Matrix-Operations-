# 3D Camera Transformations and Projections using Matrix Operations

A mathematical and computational project that demonstrates how matrix operations are used in 3D computer graphics to transform, view, project, and map 3D objects onto a 2D screen.

The project provides an interactive interface for exploring model transformations, camera transformations, perspective and orthographic projections, and the complete transformation pipeline from 3D coordinates to screen coordinates.

## Objectives

- Understand 3D transformations using matrices.
- Implement translation, rotation, and scaling mathematically.
- Understand camera transformations using position and target coordinates.
- Explore perspective and orthographic projection.
- Understand the transformation pipeline from 3D coordinates to 2D screen coordinates.
- Visualize the effect of different transformation and camera parameters.
- Connect mathematical concepts with practical computer graphics applications.

## Features

- Interactive 3D Cube and Pyramid visualization.
- Select between Cube, Pyramid, or Both.
- Camera position and target controls.
- Translation, rotation, and scaling of 3D objects.
- Perspective and orthographic projection.
- Adjustable Field of View (FOV).
- Adjustable near and far clipping planes.
- Adjustable orthographic projection boundaries.
- Display of Model, View, and Projection matrices.
- Matrix multiplication demonstration.
- NDC (Normalized Device Coordinates) calculation.
- Conversion of NDC coordinates to screen coordinates.
- Interactive visualization using Streamlit.
